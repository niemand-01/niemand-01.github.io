Hello there, glad to meet you in this way. Finally, i decide to start my first blog at my github.io, because there are some ideas i want to share and i need a place to better hosting the API Documentation of `TradeTest`. 

Credits to Jekyll (a open sourced library for building simplfied site without writing ruby) &
Minimal Mistakes (a free theme contributed by community members), i can share my notions, emotions and considerations with as least limits as possible.

In the future, i will post more take-away knowledges regarding the manual/quant trading strategies on this site. 

Hope to see them soon!
